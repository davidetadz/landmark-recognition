# CapsNet-Pytorch
Pytorch version of Hinton's paper: [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)
> Some implementations of CapsNet online have potential problems and it's uneasy to realize the bugs since MNIST is too simple to achieve satisfying accuracy.

# Highlights
- Highly abstraction of `Caps` layer, by re-writing the function `create_cell_fn` you can implement your own sub-network inside `Caps` Layer
```python
    def create_cell_fn(self):  
            """  
            create sub-network inside a capsule.  
            :return:  
            """  
            conv1 = nn.Conv2d(self.conv1_kernel_num, self.caps1_conv_kernel_num, kernel_size = self.caps1_conv_kernel_size, stride = self.caps1_conv1_stride)  
            #relu = nn.ReLU(inplace = True)  
            #net = nn.Sequential(conv1, relu)  
            return conv1  
```
- Highly abstraction of routing layer by class `Route`, you can take use of `Caps` Layer and `Route` Layer to construct any type of network
- No DigitsCaps Layer, and we just just the output of `Route` layer.

## Status

- Currently we train our model for 30 epochs, which means it is potentially promising if more epochs are used to train
- We don not use reconstruction loss now, and will add it later
- The critical part of code is well commented with each dimension changes, which means you can follow the comments to understand the routing mechnism

## TODO
- add reconstruction loss
- test on more convincing dataset, such as ImagetNet

# Usage

## Step 1. Install Conda, CUDA, cudnn and Pytorch
>conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith

## Step 2. Clone the repository to local
>git clone https://github.com/dragen1860/CapsNet-Pytorch.git  
>cd CapsNet-Pytorch

## Step 3. Train CapsNet on MNIST

1. please modify the variable `glo_batch_size = 125` to appropriate size according to your GPU memory size.
2. run
>$ python main.py
3. turn on tensorboard
>$ tensorboard --logdir runs 

## Step 4. Validate CapsNet on MNIST
OR you can comment the part of train code and test its performance with pretrained model `mdl` file.

# Results

| Model    | Routing | Reconstruction | MNIST |   |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------|---|
| Baseline | -       | -              | 0.39  |   |
| Paper    | 3       | no             | 0.35  |   |
| Ours     | 3       | no             | **0.34**|   |

It takes about 150s per epoch for single GTX 970 4GB Card.
